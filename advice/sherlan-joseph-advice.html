                <h4>Focus on the Fundamentals</h4>
                <p>Think you don't need to go over the basics? Think again. Like in any field, getting a good grasp of
                    the fundamentals is critically important to achieving long-term success. The information you learn 
                    at the beginning of your programming education or coding bootcamp will allow you to grasp the logic 
                    of more complicated topics further along. If you don't learn basic computer programming, you could 
                    fall behind in the future. So, even if the fundamentals seem boring or unimportant at first, you need 
                    to recognize how essential it is to learn them.</p>

                
                <h4>Learn to Ask for Help</h4>
                <p>Knowing when to ask for help is a skill you'll need throughout the course of your life, not just in your 
                    coding career. The fact of the matter is, you aren't going to know everything, especially when you're just 
                    starting out. The fastest and easiest way to gain the skills you need to have for a successful coding career
                     is to ask those who have the answers. After you try to figure out the answer to your question on your own, be 
                     sure to ask someone else. Whether you do it in person or online, speaking to your mentor or teacher and listening 
                     to what they have to say is critical when you are learning to become a computer programmer.</p>
